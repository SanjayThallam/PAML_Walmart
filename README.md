## Instructions on how to set up the environment

For this project, there are a few steps that must be followed. First, pull the repo down to your local machine. Then install the environment using the env.yml file. This is needed to ensure that all of the packages work together. Then afterward, download the dataset files from the following Google Drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Q4-JHr_37VoOixU0egUliE6KKFAR6ik0?usp=sharing . Ensure that when the 4 CSV files are downloaded they are in the same folder as the streamlit.py file.
